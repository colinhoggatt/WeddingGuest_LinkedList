# Wedding Guest Linked List (CS32 Proj 2)

### Project Description

The goal of this project is to implement a linked list class called `WeddingGuest` that stores guests for a wedding.  
Given a class definition for the linked list of wedding guests, implement the member functions to behave correctly. Member functions include, but are not limited to:
- Appending a guest
- Altering an existing guest
- Swapping guest lists
- Verifying existing guests
- Deletion of guests
- Traversing the guest list
